A possible neural network library in C.
Though, the goal is just providing a simpler library to Tensorflow, Pytorch etc. not replacing any of them as those are most likely far better and advanced.
I just wanted to run and train models on low-end android devices and other devices that support C without worry about binary sizes.
I would love your feedback.
